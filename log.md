# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to javascript, including variables, data types e.t.c.

**Thoughts:** The first day was interactive and fun though i was confused about this sign (%) because freecodecamp called it the remainder sign and said it is wrong to call it the modulus sign while w3schools referred to it as the modulus sign.

### Day 2: November 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about strings, its immutability, the length property and bracket notation. I also completed the word blank task.

**Thoughts**: I struggled a little with the escaping characters, but i smashed at last.

### Day 3: November 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about arrays: its mutability, pop, push, shift, unshift.
I also learnt about functions: its definition, parameters, scope, e.t.c.
i completed the shopping list and stand in line tasks.

**Thoughts**: It was fun but i needed to make personal research on how to remove an element from in between an array using splice(). Also i needed to assimilate the push, pop, shift and unshift properties.
