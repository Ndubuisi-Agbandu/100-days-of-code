# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to javascript, including variables, data types e.t.c.

**Thoughts:** The first day was interactive and fun though i was confused about this sign (%) because freecodecamp called it the remainder sign and said it is wrong to call it the modulus sign while w3schools referred to it as the modulus sign.

### Day 2: November 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about strings, its immutability, the length property and bracket notation. I also completed the word blank task.

**Thoughts**: I struggled a little with the escaping characters, but i smashed at last.
